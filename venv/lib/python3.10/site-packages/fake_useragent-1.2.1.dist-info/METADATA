[![Test & Deploy fake-useragent](https://github.com/fake-useragent/fake-useragent/actions/workflows/action.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/fake-useragent/fake-useragent/actions/workflows/action.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

# fake-useragent

Up-to-date simple useragent faker with real world database.

## Features

- Data is pre-downloaded from [techblog.willshouse.com](https://techblog.willshouse.com/2012/01/03/most-common-user-agents/) and the data is part of the package
- Retrieves user-agent strings locally
- Supports Python 3.x

### Installation

```sh
pip install fake-useragent
```

Or if you have multiple Python / pip versions installed, use `pip3`:

```sh
pip3 install fake-useragent
```

### Usage

Simple usage example, see below for more examples:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent()

# Get a random browser user-agent string
print(ua.random)

# Or get user-agent string from a specific browser
print(ua.chrome)
# Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
print(ua.google)
# Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_7_4) AppleWebKit/537.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/24.0.1290.1 Safari/537.13
print(ua['google chrome'])
# Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/113.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
print(ua.firefox)
# Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
print(ua.ff)
# Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
print(ua.safari)
# Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.2 Safari/605.1.15
```

#### Additional usage

Additional features that fake-useragent now offers since v1.2.0.

If you want to specify your own browser list, you can do that via the `browsers` argument (default is: `["chrome", "edge", "firefox", "safari"]`).  
This example will only return random useragents from Edge and Chrome:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent(browsers=['edge', 'chrome'])
ua.random
```

_Note:_ Fakeuser-agent knowns about: Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari. Other browsers are not popular enough and aren't part of our dataset we use.

---

If you want to specify your own operating systems, you can do that via the `os` argument (default is: `["windows", "macos", "linux"]`).  
In this example you will only get Linux useragents back:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent(os='linux')
ua.random
```

---

If you want to return more popular useragent strings, you can play with the `min_percentage` argument (default is: `0.0`, meaning all useragents will match).  
In this example you get only useragents that have a minimum usage percentage of 1.3% (or higher):

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent(min_percentage=1.3)
ua.random
```

_Hint:_ Of-course you can **combine all those arguments** to you liking!

### Notes

You can override the fallback string using the `fallback` parameter, in very rare cases something failed:

```py
import fake_useragent

ua = fake_useragent.UserAgent(fallback='your favorite Browser')
# in case if something went wrong, one more time it is REALLY!!! rare case
ua.random == 'your favorite Browser'
```

If you will try to get unknown browser:

```py
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
ua = UserAgent()
print(ua.unknown)
#Error occurred during getting browser: randm, but was suppressed with fallback.
#Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
```

If you need to safe some attributes from overriding them in UserAgent by `__getattr__` method
use `safe_attrs` you can pass there attributes names.
At least this will prevent you from raising FakeUserAgentError when attribute not found.

For example, when using fake*useragent with `injections <https://github.com/tailhook/injections>`* you need to:

```py
import fake_useragent

ua = fake_useragent.UserAgent(safe_attrs=('__injections__',))
```

Please, do not use if you don't understand why you need this.
This is magic for rarely extreme case.

### Experiencing issues?

Make sure that you using latest version!

```sh
pip install --upgrade fake-useragent
```

Or if that isn't working, try to install the latest package version like this (`1.2.0` is an example, check what the [latest version is on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/fake-useragent/#history)):

```sh
pip install fake-useragent==1.2.0
```

Check version via the Python console:

```py
import fake_useragent

print(fake_useragent.VERSION)
```

And you are always welcome to post [issues](https://github.com/fake-useragent/fake-useragent/issues).

Please do not forget to mention the version that you are using.

### For Developers

Since GitHub Actions is unable to reach willshouse.com and has Cloudflare protection. We can run the script below to automatically scrape the user-agent strings from the external data source. The script will copy the [JSONlines](https://jsonlines.org/) file to the `src/fake_useragent/data` directory. Execute:

```sh
./update_data_file.sh
```

The data JSON file is part of the Python package, see [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml). Read more about [Data files support](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html).

### Python Virtual Environment

We encourage to use Python virtual environment before installing Pip packages, like so:

```sh
python -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

#### Tests

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
tox
```

#### Linting

To fix imports:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
ruff --select="I" --fix .
```
